# VLM-3R: Vision-Language Models Augmented with Instruction-Aligned 3D Reconstruction

**VLM-3R is a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) framework integrating 3D reconstructive instruction tuning for deep spatial understanding from monocular video.**

The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for human-like visual-spatial intelligence. VLM-3R processes monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens that represent spatial understanding. Through the utilization of Spatial-Visual–View Fusion technique and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions. This enables the model to perform monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning.

## 🛠️ VLM-3R Architecture

The core of VLM-3R is a pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM), integrated with modules for deriving geometric encodings, camera view encodings, and visual features from the input video; these diverse inputs are subsequently fused effectively with language representations. VLM-3R does not rely on pre-built 3D maps or external depth sensors. This design directly addresses key limitations of existing approaches, such as the common inadequacy of Video LLMs in perceiving rich spatial context from monocular video and the restrictive dependency of many specialized 3D-LLMs on prior 3D map or depth sensor inputs.

**Architecture Overview Diagram:**

*Our method takes monocular video and language instruction as input. Visual Encoder coupled with Spatial Encoder extract frame-level appearance, camera view position, and globally aligned geometry. Visual-Geometry Fusion integrates these through attention and projection layers to create 3D-aware visual features for the LMM. During the inference stage, this fusion enables reliable spatial and temporal reasoning.*

**Key Components:**

- **3D Reconstructive Tokenization:** Utilizes the pre-trained CUT3R model to process monocular video frame-by-frame, extracting implicit latent representations (enriched feature tokens and camera view tokens). These tokens serve as rich 3D reconstructive tokens, compactly encoding observed 3D geometry and camera perspective without relying on explicit point clouds.

- **Spatial-Visual-View Fusion:** Employs a cross-attention mechanism where the VLM's native visual tokens (Hv) attend to a unified 3D representation (Z3D, formed by concatenated 3D feature tokens Ft′ and camera view tokens zt′). The output of this attention stage (Hattn) is then residually connected with the original visual tokens (Hv′=Hv+Hattn). This enriched representation Hv′ subsequently passes through a two-layer MLP projector for alignment with the LMM.

  ```
  Z_3D = Concat(F'_t, z'_t)
  H_attn = CrossAttention(Query: H_v, KeyValue: Z_3D)
  H'_v = H_v + H_attn
  ProjectedFeatures = MLP_2-layer(H'_v)
  ```

- **Training Objective & Fine-tuning Strategy:** Adopts the same learning objective as LLaVA-NeXT-Video. To achieve efficient adaptation, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is employed for fine-tuning, which involves updating parameters within the 3D fusion attention block and the projection layers.

## 📊 Datasets & Benchmarks

- **Instruction Tuning & Benchmark Training Data:** Our main instruction tuning dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face. This dataset also includes the training data for VSiBench and VSTiBench: [Journey9ni/VLM-3R-DATA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Journey9ni/VLM-3R-DATA).
- **Data Generation Scripts:** The scripts for generating our instruction tuning data are now available. Please refer to the [`vlm_3r_data_process/README.md`](vlm_3r_data_process/README.md) for detailed instructions.
- **Multimodal Spatial Instruction Data Generation:** A scalable, automated data generation pipeline produced over **200,000** general question-answer pairs for spatial reasoning from monocular video, and **4,225** embodied route planning data instances generated using simulators. This data is derived from existing 3D datasets like ScanNet, ScanNet++, and ARKitScenes, processed via detailed spatio-temporal scene graphs to automatically generate QA pairs for tasks such as object counting, relative distance/direction, appearance order, object size, absolute distance, and room size.
- **Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence Benchmark (VSTI-Bench):** Contains approximately **138,600** QA pairs to assess LMMs' ability to perceive and reason about dynamic spatial configurations. The VSTiBench **test set** is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Journey9ni/vstibench).

## 🚀 Training

For detailed instructions on training the VLM-3R model, please refer to our primary training script as an example: `scripts/VLM_3R/train_vsibench.sh`.

```bash
# Example training command. Please see the script for more details.
bash scripts/VLM_3R/train_vsibench.sh
```

**Important Note on Video Data:** We do not provide the raw video data from datasets like ScanNet, ScanNet++, or ARKitScenes. You will need to download and process them yourself. The training scripts expect the video data to follow a specific path structure. For instance, the anticipated path for a ScanNet video should be `data/vlm_3r_data/scannet/videos/scene0191_00.mp4`.

**Optional: Pre-extracting Spatial Features**
To significantly accelerate the training process, you can pre-extract spatial features from all your videos beforehand. This avoids redundant feature computation during each training epoch. You can use the provided script for this purpose:

```bash
# Example command for feature extraction
python scripts/extract_spatial_features.py \\
    --input-dir /path/to/your/video/dataset \\
    --output-dir /path/to/save/extracted_features \\
    --cut3r-weights-path /path/to/your/cut3r_weights.pth \\
    --processor-config-path /path/to/your/processor_config.json \\
    --gpu-ids 0,1,2,3
```
Please see the script for a full list of arguments. You will need to create the `processor_config.json` file with the following content:
```json
{
  "do_convert_rgb": null,
  "do_normalize": true,
  "do_rescale": true,
  "do_resize": true,
  "image_mean": [
    0.5,
    0.5,
    0.5
  ],
  "image_processor_type": "SiglipImageProcessor",
  "image_std": [
    0.5,
    0.5,
    0.5
  ],
  "processor_class": "LlavaProcessor",
  "resample": 3,
  "rescale_factor": 0.00392156862745098,
  "size": {
    "height": 384,
    "width": 384
  }
}
```

**How Pre-computed Features are Loaded:**

The training script automatically detects and loads pre-computed features. Here's how it works:

1. **Directory Structure**: Pre-computed features should follow this structure:
   ```
   your_data_folder/
   ├── videos/
   │   └── scene0191_00.mp4
   └── spatial_features/
       └── scene0191_00.pt
   ```

2. **Automatic Loading**: During training, the system automatically checks for pre-computed features by:
   - Taking the video path from your data configuration
   - Replacing `.mp4` with `.pt` and `videos` with `spatial_features`
   - Loading the features if the file exists

3. **No Configuration Needed**: You don't need to modify any configuration files. The training script (see `llava/train/train.py`, lines 1805-1808) handles this automatically:
   ```python
   spatial_features_path = os.path.join(video_folder, self.list_data_dict[i]['video'].replace('.mp4', '.pt').replace('videos', 'spatial_features'))
   if os.path.exists(spatial_features_path):
       spatial_features = torch.load(spatial_features_path)
   ```

This approach significantly speeds up training by avoiding redundant feature extraction during each epoch.

Make sure to configure the paths to your video data, benchmark datasets, and desired model output directories within the script.

## 📈 Evaluation

```bash
cd thinking-in-space # Ensure you are in the correct directory if it's a submodule

conda create --name vsibench python=3.10 -y
conda activate vsibench
